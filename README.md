### 👋 Hi, I’m @love-bhardwaj - Associate Software Engineer @Snyk ✨

I have a masters degree in Electronics Systems Engineering a bachelors degree in Electronics and Communctions. Early on in my life I did not have access to a computer until 8th or 9th grade 😅. Even after that I didn't have the exposure to programming 💻. But during my college/university days, I came accross various programming concepts and some or most of them weren't even part of my curriculum. So, you can say I am self taught soft developer. Now every day in my life is about learning and sharing my knowledge with other, who may be going through the same journey.

I started off with C/C++ ✨, moving on to Jave and Android programming and now have settled on JavaScript/TypeScript and Go. I can tell you my favorite are C/C++ and Go. I loving programming and I love being a Gopher 😍. Most the time, you will find me doing something in Go 😃
